Total credit is 30 points
-------------------------

you got 17 out of 30 which is 56.67% which is a not so good.....

Notes:
======
I only see the code for the tree traverser and the Priority Queue programs in
your repo, so I don't know what happened there.  I've looked in my clone and
also on line in your repo in GitHub but don'e see any code for the hashing
problems.

I'm evaluating what's here, and due to the lateness of the time that's all I
can do, regrettably.

The Tree Traverer looks good and works as advertised.  Nice that you used my
code so I would know exactly what the tree structure was for the output!

For your priority queue using the heap, it was supposed to have been turned
into a MAX heap, but you have a MIN heap, according to the diagram that your
program puts out.  However, when you remove things and list them out, it is
certain that you ARE using a MAX heap, since the largest number comes out
first!  Interesting.  Either way, you earned full credit.

I wish you had been able to complete the linear probing and digit folding
problems, but at least SOME credit is better than NO credit for the homework
assignment, right?

Still, nice job, and a decent finish to the semester!
