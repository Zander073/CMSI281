Homework03 Evaluation
======================
You MUST do problem 1, the "odd-even sort"

You MUST do EITHER problem 2, Huffman, OR problem 3, Simon.
Whichever one you choose is your option, but you must indicate
which one you choose.  If you want to do both of them, you will
be given extra credit for whatever points you get correct on
the second problem.  For example, if you choose to do Simon and
it is completely correct, and you do Huffman for extra credit
and get 5 out of 7 correct, you will get 136% for the assignment.
The extra points will be applied at the end of the semester to
improve your overall score for the course.

Assuming odd-even sort is correct, of course....

Nice work on this assignment!

Total credit is 14 for Sorter and either Simon or Huffman
   extra credit is 7 points for other of Simon or Huffman
-------------------------
 Grand total is 21 points for all three

You earned:
-----------
you got 14 out of 14 which is 100% which is an A-plus

you got 21 out of 14 which is 150.0% which is still an A-plus

Very nice work on this assignment!

EXCEELENT WORK!!  Your odd-even sorter works perfectly, and I really like the
way you output each stage so the user can see what's happening.  Your Simon
game is great and you clear the screen very effectively so the user has to
really pay attention!

VERY nice work on this assignment.  Keep up the good work!
