Homework02 Evaluation
======================

WOW, you two did an awesome job!  Everything works as advertised, you test
all the methods, you output messages to the user so they know what is going
on with the programs, and your code looks really nice, showing good attention
to the "arts and crafts" part of building code.  You even did the Josephus
extra credit problem!

Very VERY nice work, and you earned full credit on everything!

Keep up the good work!!
